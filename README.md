Repository for Coursera courses in "Data Science Specialization" by Johns Hopkins University

# Note to peer reviewers of course "Machine Learning":
The R markdown and HTML files to review are "Course-Project-Machine-Learning.Rmd" and
"Course-Project-Machine-Learning.html", respectively. Because of the inline graphics for the plots, the html file seems to be to big to be rendered properly in the gh-pages branch on Github. Please save the file locally and open it in a browser. Thanks!
